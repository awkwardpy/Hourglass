# Hourglass Pattern in C

This C program prints an hourglass pattern of stars based on the number of rows specified by the user. It creates a beautiful symmetric pattern that looks like an hourglass.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**: You can compile the program using a C compiler. For example, if you have `gcc` installed, you can use the following command:

    ```sh
    gcc hourglass.c -o hourglass
    ```

2. **Run the Program**: After compiling, you can run the program:

    ```sh
    ./hourglass
    ```

3. **Input the Number of Rows**: The program will prompt you to enter the number of rows. Make sure to enter an odd number, as this program requires an odd number of rows to create the hourglass pattern.

4. **View the Hourglass**: The program will then display the hourglass pattern based on the input.

## Example

Suppose you enter `5` as the number of rows:
